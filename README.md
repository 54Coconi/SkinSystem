# SkinSystem
The SkinSystem for make minecraft's server can change their player skin with custom skin.

## Introduction
   First! sorry for my bad english. So this project has been developing for minecraft server's owners that turn online-mode to false the cause of this configuration is if player plays minecraft with non-premium account they can't upload any skin like a premium account with this reason the developers of this project try to improve that variation. Then now the SkinSystem is done
   The main keys of this system are SkinRestorer plugin and MineSkin. We want to say "Thank you" to all developer of SkinRestorer and MinSkin.
